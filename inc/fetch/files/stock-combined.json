Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man's struggle for justice. But the weight of history will only tolerate so much. A benchmark of classic American literature, To Kill A Mockingbird approaches the highly sensitive topic of racism in 1930s America with humour, warmth and compassion, making it widely recognised as one of the best books of the twentieth century and in American literature.","modified":"2022-10-16 18:50:36","onhand":12,"salesorder":9,"weight":"171"},{"code":"9780099450252","descript":"Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time","sellpinc1":215,"memo":"Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time - The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a murder mystery novel like no other.The detective, and narrator, is Christopher Boone.

This \"Penguin Classics\" edition is edited with an introduction by Patricia Ingham. When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the North of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In \"North and South\" Gaskell skilfully fused individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale created one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature. In her introduction Patricia Ingham examines Elizabeth Gaskell's treatment of geographical, economic and class differences, and the male and female roles portrayed in the novel. This edition also includes further reading, notes and a useful glossary. Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-65) was born in London, but grew up in the north of England in the village of Knutsford. In 1832 she married the Reverend William Gaskell and had four daughters, and one son who died in infancy.

Antigone, his best-known play, was performed in 1944 in Nazi-controlled Paris and provoked fierce controversy. In defying the tyrant Creon and going to her death, Antigone conveyed to Anouilh's compatriots a covert message of heroic resistance; but the author's characterisaation of Creon also seemed to exonerate Marshal Petain and his fellow collaborators. More ambivalent than his ancient model, Sophocles, Anouilh uses Greek myth to explore the disturbing moral dilemmas of our times. Commentary and notes by Ted Freeman.

In this classic fable, George Orwell sounds a powerful warning of the dangers of totalitarianism.

Die digter worstel om die \"fyner taal\" te vind wat die betekenis en waarde van Moeder Aarde duidelik kan laat klink. Daarmee druk die digter ook iets van die waarde van poesie uit: soos Gerrit Komrij in sy inleiding tot Die Afrikaanse poesie in 'n duisend en enkele gedigte aandui, teken dit op wat uit die verlede waardevol bly; gee dit ons sowel ankerpunte as drome in ons daaglikse bestaan; en vir die toekoms is dit 'n bewaarplek - 'n \"magasyn\" - van wat waardevol bly. Die gedigte is natuurlik nie net gekies om te weerspieel wat poesie is nie. Dit wil ook iets van die leefwereld van die hedendaagse leser weergee: die skoonheid van die aarde, die verrukking van die liefde, die hoop op 'n sinvolle toekoms en die betekenis van elke oenskynlik onbelangrike mens se aardse bestaan.

This translation by Don Taylor, accurate yet poetic, was made for a BBC TV production of the Theban Plays in 1986, which he also directed.

Living on a peach farm in South Carolina with her father, she has only one friend: Rosaleen, a black servant whose sharp exterior hides a tender heart. South Carolina in the sixties is a place where segregation is still considered a cause worth fighting for. When racial tension explodes one summer afternoon, and Rosaleen is arrested and beaten, Lily is compelled to act. Fugitives from justice and from Lily's harsh and unyielding father, they follow a trail left by the woman who died ten years before. Finding sanctuary in the home of three beekeeping sisters, Lily starts a journey as much about her understanding of the world, as about the mystery surrounding her mother.","modified":"2022-06-10 15:10:51","onhand":5,"salesorder":0,"weight":"269"},{"code":"9780747568988","descript":"Al Capone Does My Shirts","sellpinc1":205.00000049999999873762135393917560577392578125,"memo":"Al Capone Does My Shirts - When Moose Flanagan and his family move home, yet again, and become residents of the famous prison island Alcatraz, things get interesting.

Winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards. In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut--young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training. Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives. Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.","modified":"2022-11-08 16:58:00","onhand":6,"salesorder":0,"weight":"181"},{"code":"9780853203872","descript":"'n Nuuskierige Buurman","sellpinc1":57.9500000000000028421709430404007434844970703125,"memo":"'n Nuuskierige Buurman","modified":"2022-06-09 11:50:10","onhand":2,"salesorder":0,"weight":"80"},{"code":"9780857360007","descript":"Trinity Music Theory Workbook Grade 1","sellpinc1":200,"memo":"Trinity Music Theory Workbook Grade 1 - Theory of Music Workbook for Trinity College London written examinations, containing all requirements for Theory of Music Grade 1 examinations from 2009 onwards.

Maya Angelou's debut memoir has become an classic beloved worldwide. Her six volumes of autobiography are a testament to the her talents and resilience.. Loving the world, she also knows its cruelty. As a Black woman she has known discrimination and extreme poverty, but also hope, joy, achievement and celebration. In this first volume of her six books of autobiography, Maya Angelou beautifully evokes her childhood with her grandmother in the American south of the 1930s. She learns the power of the white folks at the other end of town and suffers the terrible trauma of rape by her mother's lover. However, far from being dispiriting, James Baldwin writes, 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.''I write about being a Black American woman, however, I am always talking about what it's like to be a human being.

His path isn't clear--and the pressure to join a \"crew,\" as his brother did, is always there. When Lolly and his friend are beaten up and robbed, joining a crew almost seems like the safe choice. But building a fantastical Lego city at the community center provides Lolly with an escape--and an unexpected bridge back to the world.

Already being proclaimed a classic in children's literature and compared to the likes of Roald Dahl and Eva Ibbotson, Katherine Rundell's Rooftoppers merges fantasy and historical fiction with sophisticated lyrical prose and vivid imagery that will delight middle grade readers, tweens, teens, and parents and teachers alike. Join plucky heroine Sophie, her eccentric guardian Charles, and her intrepid orphan allies on the rooftops of Victorian Paris, as they encounter suspense and adventure that will keep kids of all ages on the edge of their seats right to the heartwarming end. My mother is still alive, and she is going to come for me one day. Everyone thinks that Sophie is an orphan. Found floating in a cello case and swaddled in a Beethoven score, she is the only recorded female survivor of a shipwreck on the English Channel. But Sophie remembers seeing her mother wave for help...Charles, a fellow survivor and an eccentric scholar, finds Sophie and brings her home to his London bachelor flat. Raised in a quirky home filled with music, words and love (though questionable diet), Sophie grows into a free-spirited tomboy with a taste for Shakespeare and the unshakeable belief that anything is possible. And you should never ignore a possible. So when the child welfare agency in its bureaucratic wisdom threatens to send Sophie to an orphanage, the optimistic girl and her odd guardian flee to Paris on a quest to find her mother, starting with the only clue she has - the address of the cello maker. Secured in an attic to evade the French authorities, Sophie escapes through the skylight and meets Matteo and his network of rooftoppers - homeless urchins who tightrope walk above the busy streets below, dining on pigeons and snails alongside the gargoyles and bell tower of Notre Dame. Together they set out on an unimaginable adventure, scouring the city for Sophie's mother before she is caught and sent back to London - and most importantly, before she loses hope. Readers who enjoyed the Lemony Snicket books, Ellen Potter's The Kneebone Boy, Cornelia Funke's The Thief Lord, and Sally Gardner's I, Coriander will want to put Rooftoppers on their Must Read list.","modified":"2022-03-25 09:04:58","onhand":4,"salesorder":0,"weight":""},{"code":"9781529009200","descript":"Seven Letter Word","sellpinc1":175,"memo":"Seven Letter Word - 'My name is Finlay McIntosh.

It's like the word is there in my mouth, fully formed and then, just as it's ready to leave my lips. POP! It jumps and ricochets and bounces around my gob. Except it isn't funny at all, because there's not a thing I can do about it.' Finlay's mother vanished two years ago. And ever since then his stutter has become almost unbearable. Bullied at school and ignored by his father, the only way to get out the words which are bouncing around in his head is by writing long letters to his ma which he knows she will never read, and by playing Scrabble online. But when Finlay is befriended by an online Scrabble player called Alex, everything changes. Could it be his mother secretly trying to contact him? Or is there something more sinister going on? A Seven-Letter Word is an evocative and heartfelt story from the multi-award-winning author of Smart, Kim Slater.","modified":"2022-06-21 11:49:16","onhand":2,"salesorder":0,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781529013108","descript":"Murder on the Safari Star","sellpinc1":185,"memo":"Murder on the Safari Star","modified":"2022-07-06 09:03:33","onhand":3,"salesorder":0,"weight":""},{"code":"9781529019292","descript":"Shuggie Bain","sellpinc1":240,"memo":"Shuggie Bain","modified":"2022-10-14 16:14:46","onhand":2,"salesorder":1,"weight":""},{"code":"9781529109436","descript":"Living While Black","sellpinc1":0,"memo":"Living While Black","modified":"2022-08-18 11:06:01","onhand":0,"salesorder":0,"weight":""},{"code":"9781529109603","descript":"Diary of a Young Naturalist","sellpinc1":240,"memo":"Diary of a Young Naturalist","modified":"2022-10-30 22:39:27","onhand":4,"salesorder":8,"weight":"207"},{"code":"9781530154685","descript":"Music Theory Grade 5","sellpinc1":420,"memo":"Music Theory Grade 5","modified":"2022-11-06 23:09:37","onhand":3,"salesorder":0,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781559363860","descript":"Train Driver & other Plays","sellpinc1":363.94999999999998863131622783839702606201171875,"memo":"Train Driver & other Plays","modified":"2022-09-30 11:09:52","onhand":22,"salesorder":0,"weight":"300"},{"code":"9781586638450","descript":"Romeo & Juliet (No Fear Shakespeare)","sellpinc1":305,"memo":"Romeo & Juliet (No Fear Shakespeare) (Spark Notes)","modified":"2022-11-04 10:10:29","onhand":1,"salesorder":6,"weight":"450"},{"code":"9781586638467","descript":"Macbeth (No Fear Shakespeare) (Spark Notes)","sellpinc1":305,"memo":"Macbeth (No Fear Shakespeare) (Spark Notes)","modified":"2022-11-04 10:07:33","onhand":2,"salesorder":3,"weight":"250"},{"code":"9781586638481","descript":"Midsummer Night's Dream (No Fear Ed.)","sellpinc1":305,"memo":"Midsummer Night's Dream (No Fear Shakespeare) (Spark Notes)","modified":"2022-10-30 21:13:50","onhand":1,"salesorder":6,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781586638528","descript":"Othello (No Fear Shakespeare) (Spark Notes)","sellpinc1":305,"memo":"Othello (No Fear Shakespeare) (Spark Notes) ","modified":"2022-10-30 21:20:57","onhand":1,"salesorder":6,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781596435520","descript":"Anya's Ghost","sellpinc1":505,"memo":"Anya's Ghost","modified":"2022-11-04 10:09:39","onhand":6,"salesorder":5,"weight":"350"},{"code":"9781616202415","descript":"Purple Hibiscus","sellpinc1":485,"memo":"Purple Hibiscus - Longlisted for the 2004 Man Booker Prize Shortlisted for the 2004 Orange Prize A haunting tale of an Africa and an adolescence undergoing tremendous changes by a talented young Nigerian writer.

But when a client turns up dead and the cops confiscate her last paycheck, she's forced to take on her least favourite kind of job - missing persons. Being hired by famously reclusive music producer Odi Huron to find a teenybop pop star should be her ticket out of Zoo City, the festering slum where the criminal underclass, marked by their animals, live in the shadow of the undertow. Instead, it catapults Zinzi deeper into the underbelly of a city twisted by crime and magic, where she'll be forced to confront the dark secrets of former lives - including her own.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa\u2019s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born A Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man\u2019s relationship with his fearless, rebellious and fervently religious mother\u2014his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother\u2019s unconventional, unconditional love.","modified":"2022-06-21 11:41:08","onhand":1,"salesorder":0,"weight":"270"},{"code":"9781770106338","descript":"Intruders","sellpinc1":230,"memo":"Intruders","modified":"2022-06-21 11:45:52","onhand":6,"salesorder":0,"weight":"200"},{"code":"9781770106598","descript":"Born a Crime","sellpinc1":180,"memo":"Born a Crime - Adapted for younger readers from Born a Crime: And Other Stories- the #1 South African and New York Times bestseller. \u2018If my mother had one goal, it was to free my mind.

How do you apply it to your life:\u201d That was every day of my life. My mom did what the school didn\u2019t. She taught me how to think. In Born a Crime, Trevor Noah shares his remarkable story of growing up in South Africa with a black South African mother and a white European father at a time when it was against the law for a mixed-race child to exist. But he did exist and from the beginning, the often-misbehaved Trevor used his quick wits and humour to navigate a harsh life. This edition of Trevor\u2019s fascinating memoir blends drama, comedy and tragedy to depict the day-to-day trials that turned a mischievous young boy into a restless young man. Against all the odds, and supported his mom\u2019s unwavering love and indomitable will, Trevor overcame many obstacles and created a promising future for himself. Born a Crime provides a fascinating and honest perspective on South Africa\u2019s racial history and it will also inspire readers looking to improve their own lives.

Her grandmother seems strangely unwelcoming and Martine has a difficult time settling in at her new school, where she is conspicuously an outsider. But she has an ally in Tendai - one of the keepers on the reserve, from whom she learns the lore and survival techniques of the bush, and in Grace - who instantly senses there is something special about Martine. There are secrets about Sawubona (the reserve) just waiting to be revealed, and rumours too about a fabled white giraffe - a trophy for hunters everywhere. One night Martine, lonely and feeling slightly rebellious too, looks out of her window and see a young albino giraffe - silver, tinged with cinnamon in the moonlight. This is the beginning of her mysterious and magical adventures - her discovery of her gift of healing and a secret valley that she travels to with the giraffe, where she'll find clues about her past and future.

Little do the inhabitants know that Nandi is carrying the baby who will, in time, change all that. Taken in by Umkhulu (grandfather), whose father established the tin bucket factory that gave the town its name, Nandi gives birth to Nomvula, the Little Drummer Girl. Umkhulu remembers a past when `people were free to sing and dance', when the rain came and the townsfolk held up their tin buckets to catch the precious, life-giving drops. And then came the Silent Sir and his spokesman, the Censor, and the town went silent. As the singing and dancing and drumming dried up, so did the rain. The tin bucket factory closed, taking with it the life and purpose of Tin Town's inhabitants. Only the Little Drummer Girl can bring back that life, but at enormous personal cost. In Tin Bucket Drum, Neil Coppen achieves a small miracle. Through his lyrical script and the creative use of lighting and sound, one woman, the Narrator, succeeds in evoking a host of characters as this allegorical tale of oppression and liberation plays itself out. It is a story that offers a host of lessons for many places and many times.","modified":"2022-09-01 14:29:15","onhand":4,"salesorder":4,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781868510061","descript":"Ubomi Esibuphilayo","sellpinc1":80.900000000000005684341886080801486968994140625,"memo":"Ubomi Esibuphilayo - These poems carry a message and cover themes such as insanity, love, flowers and initiation","modified":"2022-11-06 22:38:10","onhand":6,"salesorder":0,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781868731381","descript":"iTHEMBA LAMI (NOVEL) IsiZulu","sellpinc1":94.9500000000000028421709430404007434844970703125,"memo":"iTHEMBA LAMI (NOVEL) IsiZulu","modified":"2021-07-01 14:25:20","onhand":5,"salesorder":0,"weight":"500"},{"code":"9781868902064","descript":"Junior Tweetalige Skoolwoordeboek","sellpinc1":175,"memo":"Junior Tweetalige Skoolwoordeboek - Die Pharos Junior tweetalige skoolwoordeboek fokus op leerders van graad 4\u20137 en het 'n paar nuwe, unieke kenmerke.

He in turn, along with others from Zimbabwe, Sudan and Congo, introduces the sisters to the music, wisdom and energy of Africa.

Retold for a younger audience, this exciting memoir shows how, even in a desperate situation, one boy's brilliant idea can light up the world.

It includes an audio CD which contains songs, listening excerpts and conjugation tables of the main verbs. The textbook is divided into 8 modules, each one focusing on a different teenager and his\/her life which will appeal to students' personal experiences and interests. The modules follow a clear structure consisting of 4 lessons, each presented on a double-page spread and concluding with a final task which promotes student collaboration and interaction. Each module opens with a 'contrat d'apprentissage' which clearly defines the learning objectives and encourages students to monitor their progress. In addition, there are also 'apprendre \u00e0 apprendre' sections which discuss learning strategies and put the focus on students becoming independent and being in control of their learning. The final lesson in each module is dedicated to French and Francophone culture, and to cross-curricular learning, which illustrate how French can be integrated into other subjects. There is also a double-page spread to summarise and practise the different grammatical, lexical and communicative topics covered in the module and a page which concentrates on preparing students for the DELF examination.
